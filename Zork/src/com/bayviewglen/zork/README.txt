ESCAPING ROOM 2016
Created by: Wesley Leung, Christopher Alexiev, Alexander Mark

This is a text-based game, based on the well-known game, Zork.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:

The objective is to escape the house you are trapped in by Dr. Rick and his friends. The only escape route is the helicopter
on top of the house, and you must collect 6 keys scattered throughout the house in order to start it.
Good luck and have fun!

BASIC RULES:

Your character starts with 0 calories and if your calories drop below 0, you lose the game. 
In order to raise this number, you have to eat food.
After you have gone through 2 rooms, you will have to eat again or else you will die of starvation.  

In addition to the calories, your character also has a heart attack risk.  At the start of the game it is 0 and as you eat
more junk food,your character's heart attack risk will grow.  Once it gets to 100, your character will die.  To lower
the risk, your character has to eat healthy foods.

If you run into Dr. Rick, he will throw hydrochloric acid at you and you will die.
